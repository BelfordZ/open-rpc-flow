# Issue: DependencyResolver Throws Errors Too Early in Tests

## Problem

When testing specific error types (like ExpressionError, LoopError, etc.), the DependencyResolver throws DependencyError before the other errors can be thrown. This happens because the tests are trying to use variables that don't exist in the context, which causes the DependencyResolver to throw a DependencyError during the dependency resolution phase.

## Impact

This makes it difficult to test specific error types in isolation, as the DependencyResolver will always throw its error first.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Mock the DependencyResolver**: In tests, replace the DependencyResolver with a mock that doesn't throw errors.

2. **Add a Test Mode**: Add a "test mode" to the DependencyResolver that skips dependency validation.

3. **Restructure Tests**: Restructure tests to use valid dependencies but invalid operations/expressions.

4. **Bypass Dependency Resolution**: Add a way to bypass dependency resolution for specific tests.

## Recommended Solution

Option 3 seems most practical - restructure tests to use valid dependencies but invalid operations/expressions. This would allow testing specific error types without modifying the core functionality.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
// This will throw DependencyError because 'invalidVariable' doesn't exist
params: { id: '${invalidVariable}' }
```

Use:
```typescript
// This will throw ExpressionError because the property doesn't exist
context: { validVariable: 'exists' },
params: { id: '${validVariable.nonExistentProperty}' }
```

## Priority

Medium - This affects testing but not production functionality.
