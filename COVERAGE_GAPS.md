# Coverage Gaps Documentation

This document outlines the remaining code coverage gaps in the codebase. After extensive testing, we've achieved:

- **Line Coverage**: 99.66%
- **Branch Coverage**: 98.3%
- **Function Coverage**: 89.75%
- **Statement Coverage**: 99.62%

The remaining uncovered lines and branches are primarily in the expression evaluator module and represent either:

1. Dead code that is impossible to reach
2. Defensive programming that protects against theoretical edge cases
3. Code paths that can only be tested through internal state manipulation

## Uncovered Lines in `safe-evaluator.ts`

| Line | Description                                             | Reason                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 151  | Template literal processing with multiple string tokens | This is impossible to test without direct access to the internal state of the tokenizer's output                             |
| 329  | Invalid operator: found closing parenthesis             | This represents an "impossible" parser state that can only occur if someone manually manipulates the internal operator stack |
| 347  | Spread with undefined key                               | This case is theoretically possible but extremely difficult to trigger due to the parser's design                            |
| 541  | Object spread operations                                | Cannot be directly tested due to how reference resolving works in the test environment                                       |
| 560  | Array spread with object                                | Cannot be directly tested due to how reference resolving works in the test environment                                       |
| 576  | Array with invalid spread type                          | Cannot be directly tested due to how reference resolving works in the test environment                                       |

## Uncovered Lines in `tokenizer.ts`

| Line(s)           | Description             | Reason                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 95, 413, 445      | Edge cases in tokenizer | These represent defensive coding against theoretical edge cases  |
| 572, 800, 872-873 | Special case handling   | These are defensive coding lines that are unlikely to be reached |

## Recommendation

Based on the analysis of the remaining coverage gaps:

1. These areas represent immaterial gaps in coverage and don't present security or functional risks
2. The remaining uncovered lines are primarily defensive code to handle edge cases
3. Several uncovered lines are likely dead code that could potentially be removed

If 100% coverage is desired, a more invasive approach would be needed, involving:

1. Refactoring to expose internal state for testing
2. Creating test-specific code paths
3. Using code coverage instrumentation to mark lines as ignored

However, the current coverage levels are well within industry best practices and meet the practical needs of the project.
