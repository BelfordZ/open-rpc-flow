# SafeExpressionEvaluator Test Consolidation Plan

## Background

The SafeExpressionEvaluator has numerous small test files, each focused on a specific aspect of functionality. This leads to duplication and makes it difficult to see the complete test coverage.

## Consolidation Goal

Consolidate the tests into logical groupings while maintaining the same test coverage.

## Categories

1. **Error Handling Tests**: Tests related to error handling and edge cases
2. **Operator Tests**: Tests related to operators and precedence
3. **Array and Object Tests**: Tests related to array and object handling
4. **Debug Tests**: Tests related to debugging and logging
5. **Line Coverage Tests**: Tests specifically created for line coverage

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create a new test file for each category
2. Move tests from relevant files into the new consolidated files
3. Remove the original files once confirmed that all tests pass
4. Maintain or improve overall test coverage

## Progress Updates

### 2024-06-27: Consolidation Started

- Created error handling test file with tests consolidated from 4 original test files

### 2024-06-28: Operator Tests Consolidation

- Created operator tests file with tests consolidated from 2 original test files

### 2024-06-28: Array Tests Consolidation

- Created array tests file with tests consolidated from 2 original test files

### 2024-06-29: Line Coverage and Debug Tests Consolidation

- Created line coverage and debug test files

### 2024-06-29: Array Tests Fixed

- Fixed array tests which were initially failing due to incorrect syntax
- All tests in the consolidated array test file are now passing (15 tests)

### 2024-06-29: Consolidated Tests Coverage Analysis

Consolidated files:

- `safe-evaluator-error-handling.test.ts` - 17 tests, all passing
- `safe-evaluator-operators.test.ts` - 14 tests, all passing
- `safe-evaluator-arrays.test.ts` - 15 tests, all passing
- `safe-evaluator-line-coverage.test.ts` - 15 tests, all passing
- `safe-evaluator-debug.test.ts` - 3 tests, all passing

Total tests in consolidated files: 64 tests

**Current Coverage**:

- Statements: ~53%
- Branches: ~43%
- Functions: ~53%
- Lines: ~53%

**Required Coverage**:

- Statements: 99.46%
- Branches: 97.87%
- Lines: 99.5%
- Functions: 89.75%

## Original Files Removed

- `safe-evaluator-line-151.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-line-183.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-reference-error-handling.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-unexpected-operator.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-operator-precedence.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-getPrecedence-default.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-array-elements.test.ts`
- `safe-evaluator-array-case-coverage.test.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Analyze the remaining original test files to identify unique tests not yet covered in consolidated files
2. Continue consolidation process for any remaining test files
3. Ensure all tests from original files are accounted for
4. Run coverage analysis on all consolidated test files together
5. Investigate the coverage gap between consolidated and original tests
