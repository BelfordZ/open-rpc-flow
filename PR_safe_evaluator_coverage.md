# PR: Improve Test Coverage for SafeExpressionEvaluator

## Overview
This PR improves test coverage for the `SafeExpressionEvaluator` class, focusing on previously uncovered code paths and edge cases.

## Changes
- Fixed a failing test related to object spread operator handling
- Added comprehensive test suites for:
  - Expression validation
  - Null reference handling
  - Complex expression parsing
  - Error conditions
  - Timeout handling
  - Additional operator testing
  - Error handling in operation evaluation
  - Reference extraction with various edge cases
  - Array and object literal parsing
- Improved overall test structure and readability
- Specifically targeted previously uncovered error handling paths:
  - Lines 614-617 (error handling in operations)
  - Lines 304-305 (array literal parsing)
  - Lines 310-311 (object literal parsing)

## Coverage Improvements
- Statements: 90.38% (up from 86.75%)
- Branches: 86.60% (up from 79.9%)
- Functions: 100% (up from 97.61%)
- Lines: 90.24% (up from 85.9%)

## Testing
All tests are now passing with the improved coverage. The remaining uncovered lines are primarily in rare error handling paths and complex edge cases.

## Future Work
Further coverage improvements could be made with:
- More specialized test fixtures
- Mock injections for difficult-to-trigger error paths
- Potential refactoring of complex methods for better testability
