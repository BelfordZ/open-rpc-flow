# Tokenizer Test Consolidation Progress

We're consolidating tokenizer test files to improve maintainability. The consolidation approach is to group related tests by functionality rather than by line numbers or specific implementation details.

## Completed Consolidations

1. **Array-related Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-array.test.ts`

   - ✅ `tokenizer-array-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-array-return-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-array-spread-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)

2. **Object-related Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-object.test.ts`

   - ✅ `tokenizer-object-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-object-spread-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-object-spread-special.test.ts` (DELETED)

3. **Spread Operator Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-spread.test.ts`

   - ✅ `tokenizer-array-spread-special.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-direct-spread-test.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-direct-spread.test.ts` (DELETED)

4. **Reference Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-reference.test.ts`
   - ✅ `tokenizer-reference-brace.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-reference-coverage.test.ts` (DELETED)
   - ✅ `tokenizer-reference-whitespace.test.ts` (DELETED)

## Next Steps for Consolidation

5. **More Spread Operator Tests**: Continue consolidating into `tokenizer-spread.test.ts`

   - `tokenizer-special-spreads.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-spread-array-buffer.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-spread-coverage.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-spread-helper-coverage.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-spread-operator.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-spread-push-advance.test.ts`

6. **Miscellaneous Tokenizer Tests**: Combine into `tokenizer-misc.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-238-239.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-bracket-nonzero.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-branch-coverage.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-mock-state.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-nested-brackets.test.ts`
   - `tokenizer-template-escape.test.ts`

All tests are passing after consolidation and removal of the original files, maintaining the same level of coverage.
