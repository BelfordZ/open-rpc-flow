# Tokenizer Test Consolidation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully consolidated several tokenizer test files that were previously testing the same functionality but were scattered in multiple files. The consolidation was done by grouping tests by their functional focus rather than by implementation details or line numbers.

## Completed Consolidations

1. **Array-related Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-array.test.ts`

   - Original files: 3 (DELETED)
   - Total tests: 32
   - Focus: Array literal creation, error handling, spread operators in arrays

2. **Object-related Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-object.test.ts`

   - Original files: 3 (DELETED)
   - Total tests: 16
   - Focus: Object literal handling, template literals in objects, spread operators in objects

3. **Spread Operator Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-spread.test.ts`

   - Original files: 3 (DELETED)
   - Total tests: 11
   - Focus: Spread operator handling in both arrays and objects

4. **Reference Tests**: Combined into `tokenizer-reference.test.ts`
   - Original files: 3 (DELETED)
   - Total tests: 30
   - Focus: Reference handling, nested braces in references, unterminated references, whitespace handling

## Results

- **Consolidated files**: 12 files into 4 files (original files deleted)
- **Tests passing**: 89 tests passing (100%)
- **Coverage**:
  - Statements: 85.65%
  - Branches: 78.08%
  - Functions: 100%
  - Lines: 86.52%

## Benefits

1. **Improved maintainability**: Related tests are now grouped together, making it easier to find and update tests for specific functionality.

2. **Reduced duplication**: Common setup code is now shared across related tests.

3. **Better organization**: Tests are organized by functional area rather than by implementation details or line numbers, which makes the test suite more resilient to code changes.

4. **Clearer test intent**: It's now easier to see what functionality is being tested and why.

5. **Reduced clutter**: By removing the original files, we've reduced the number of files in the test directory and eliminated potential confusion.

## Next Steps

1. Continue consolidating the remaining spread operator tests into the existing `tokenizer-spread.test.ts` file.

2. Create a new `tokenizer-misc.test.ts` file for miscellaneous tokenizer tests.

3. Once all tests have been consolidated, we should remove the remaining original files that have been consolidated.
